# WDI-Python
For Programming for Big Data assignment, I required to carry out a series of analyses of two datasets utilising RStudio, Python and MapReduce programming. 
For each of the reports, I require to provide <details>the following:
- a description of the underlying datasets
- a description of the objective of the analysis
- the data processing activities carried out
- the presentation of the final analysis results along with any associated annotations and supplementary information </details>

# Data
The analysis involves using data from The World Bankâ€™s World Development Indicators. There are 248 countries represented in this data. There are more than 1300 different economic indicators in the file. For Brazil, there are more than 30 GDP-related indicators.

# Jupyter (formerly IPython) 
is used with Pandas, which is an open source Python-based data analysis library is used.  
The Pandas library brings specifically from R, the DataFrame objects and R packages such as plyr and reshape2, and places them in a single library that can be used in Python applications.

# Visual Representations
Matplotlib, is used to create visual representations of the dataset or data analysis findings. Like Pandas, it works within Jupyter thus providing an interactive environment for plotting and exploring data.

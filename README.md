# WDI-Python
As part of my Programming for Big Data Assignment, I required to carry out a series of analyses of two datasets utilising appropriate
programming languages and programming environments. 
For each of the reports, I require to provide the following:
- a description of the underlying datasets
- a description of the objective of the analysis
- the data processing activities carried out
- the presentation of the final analysis results along with any associated annotations and supplementary information 

# What is included here
The Python code that process the data. The analysis of the data in Word Doc is not hosted here.
